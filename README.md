# Amazon Clone — Static Frontend

Short description
A simple, static Amazon-like website clone built with HTML and CSS. This is an early mockup of the storefront UI (header, search, hero, product tiles and footer). Will be updated with improvements and features in the future.

## Live preview
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the project locally.

## What’s included
- `index.html` — main static HTML markup for the clone
- `style.css` — styles for the layout and visual design
- placeholder images referenced in CSS/HTML (e.g. `amazon_logo.png`, `hero_image.jpg`, `box1_image.jpg`, etc.)

## Features
- Header with logo, address, search bar, account and cart sections
- Secondary navigation/panel with quick links
- Large hero section with callout message
- Grid of shop category tiles (product/category cards)
- Footer with multi-column links and copyright
- Uses Font Awesome for icons

## How to run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure the following files are present in the project root:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - images referenced in the markup or CSS (optional for layout testing — placeholder images work).
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Notes & roadmap
This project is an early static mockup intended for UI practice and learning. Planned future updates:
- Replace placeholders with real images and assets
- Improve responsive behavior on small screens
- Add interactivity with JavaScript (search, cart UI, dropdowns)
- Accessibility improvements and semantic markup updates
- (Optional) Connect to a backend or mock API for dynamic content
